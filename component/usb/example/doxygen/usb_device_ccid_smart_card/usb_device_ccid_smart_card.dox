# Overview

The USB CCID smart card application is a simple demonstration program based on the MCUXpresso SDK and EMV library. It is enumerated as a smart card reader.

# System Requirement

## Hardware requirements

- Mini/micro USB cable
- USB A to micro AB cable
- Hardware (Tower module/base board, and so on) for a specific device. \n Tower System module, including TWR-ELEV ( SECONDARY ELEVATOR and PRIMARY ELEVATOR ) , and TWR-POSTCARD (REV B).
- Personal Computer(PC)


## Software requirements

- The path for the project files for lite version example is:
@n <MCUXpresso_SDK_Install>/boards/<board>/usb_examples/usb_device_ccid_smart_card_lite/<rtos>/<toolchain>.
@n  For non-lite version example, the path is:
@n <MCUXpresso_SDK_Install>/boards/<board>/usb_examples/usb_device_ccid_smart_card/<rtos>/<toolchain>.
@note The <rtos> is Bare Metal or FreeRTOS OS.

- To get the PC Test tool "Snooper", go to http://www.microissuer.com/download_en.html , download, and install it.
@n See the <a href="http://www.microissuer.com/download/Snooper.Spec-002-how_to_snoopery.pdf" title="Snooper.Spec-002-how to snoopery">Snooper.Spec-002-how to snoopery</a>
and <a href="http://www.microissuer.com/download/Snooper.Spec-003-apdu_script_for_taoism.pdf" title="Snooper.Spec-003-apdu script for taoism">Snooper.Spec-003-apdu script for taoism</a>.
@note The USB CCID smart card example is only tested using Microsoft Windows<sup>Â®</sup> 7 Enterprise X64. The "Smart Card Service" in services.msc must be started.

.

# Getting Started

## Hardware Settings

@note Set the hardware jumpers (Tower system/base module) to default settings.

.

## Prepare the example

1.  Download the program to the target board.
2.  Connect the target board to the external power source (the example is self-powered).
3.  Power off the target board. Then, power on again.
4.  Connect a USB cable between the PC and the USB device port of the board.

@note For detailed instructions, see the appropriate board User's Guide.

# Run the example

1. Plug in the device, which is running the CCID smart card application, into the PC.
A smart card reader device "Microsoft Usbccid Smartcard Reader (WUDF)" in "Smart card readers" shows up as enumerated in the Device Manager.\n
For more information about the smart card readers driver, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/dn653571(v=vs.85).aspx" title="Microsoft Class Drivers for USB CCID Smart Cards">"Microsoft Class Drivers for USB CCID Smart Cards"</a>.

@image latex usb_device_ccid_smart_card_attached.jpg "The device is attached"
2. Insert a smart card. The device notifies the host that the slot has changed. The host sends the CCID command "POWER ON" to enable the card and then gets the
Answer to Reset (ATR) from the device.
If the smart card is an EMV card, the device responds with the ATR data.
Otherwise, the device rejects the card with a message "This card is not an EMV card", and responds with an error code "The card is not supported".
If the card is valid (the ATR is valid), the host tries to recognize the card by sending the APDU level command.
If the card is recognized, the host installs the diver for this card.
Otherwise, the host can't install the driver. Users need to provide the specified driver for this card or use a generic smart card driver for the host.\n
For the specified driver for the smart card, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/dn631754" title="Smart Card Minidrivers">"Smart Card Minidrivers"</a>. \n
If the device is not recognized by the host, follow these steps:
    - When a smart card is inserted and the host doesn't recognize it, the smart card driver is not installed.
@image html usb_device_ccid_smart_card_cannot_recognized.jpg
@image latex usb_device_ccid_smart_card_cannot_recognized.jpg "The device can't be recognized"
    - Install a user-provided smart card driver or an OS-provided generic smart card driver. \n
    Right click on the smart card in the Device Manager-> Select "Properties"->Select "Update Driver" in Driver table->
Select "Browse my computer for driver software"->Select "Let me pick from a list of devices drivers on my computer"->Select "Smart cards". \n
For a specified driver, select "Have Disk..." and select the specified driver in the disk.
\n For a generic driver, select "Identity Device (Microsoft Generic Profile)". When the driver is installed, the smart card works.

5.  Create a new blank script table and copy the test script to the table.
@code
clear

reset

auto_response on
prompt on

? "Test start"

g_pse                       =                "1PAY.SYS.DDF01"

? "Select PSE"
00 a4 04 00 ($g_pse)
if sw != 9000
    pause
endif
set resp

? "Read PSE"
00 b2 01 0c 00

if sw != 9000
    pause
endif


set resp
g_output_aid = gettlv( $resp, 70 61 4f )

? "Select AID"
00 a4 04 00 ( $g_output_aid )
if sw != 9000
    pause
endif

? "Test end"
@endcode

6.  Press "F7" to set script to top.
7.  Click "RST" to reset the smart card.

# Getting Started

## Hardware Settings

@note Set the hardware jumpers (Tower system/base module) to default settings.

.

## Prepare the example

1.  Download the program to the target board.
2.  Connect the target board to the external power source (the example is self-powered).
3.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in the IDE to start running
    the demo.
4.  Connect a USB cable between the PC host and the USB device port on the board.

For detailed instructions, see the appropriate board User's Guide.

7.  Open the "Sound Recorder" application and record audio for about 5-10 seconds.
9.  After recording, open the recorder file with any media player. The recorded media is identical to the instance located in the memory.

@note On Aruba which has DMIC module, please speaker to the DMIC when recording, the recorder file is the sound which is recorded by DMIC.

@note When connected to MacBook<sup>®</sup>, change the PCM format from (0x02,0x00,) to (0x01,0x00, ) in <br/>g_config_descriptor[CONFIG_DESC_SIZE] in the usb_descriptor.c.
Otherwise, it can't be enumerated and noise is present when recording with the QuickTime<sup>®</sup> player because the sampling frequency and bit resolution do not match.

@note - USB audio class 2.0 is enabled by default.

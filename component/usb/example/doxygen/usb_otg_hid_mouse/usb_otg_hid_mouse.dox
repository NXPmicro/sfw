# Overview

This OTG HID example is a simple demonstration program based on the MCUXpresso SDK. 
@n User can test the OTG functions by using the menu that is printed in the vcom.

# System Requirement

## Hardware requirements

- Mini/micro USB cable
- USB A to micro AB cable
- Hardware (tower/base board, ...) for a specific device
- Personal Computer(PC)


## Software requirements

- The project path is: 
@n <MCUXpresso_SDK_Install>/boards/<board>/usb_examples/usb_otg_hid_mouse/<rtos>/<toolchain>.
@note The <rtos> is Bare Metal or FreeRTOS OS.


# Getting Started

## Hardware Settings

@note The jumpers of the hardware (tower system/base module) needs to be set to default setting at first.

## Prepare the example 

1.  Download the program to the target board.
2.  Power off the target board and power on again.
3.  Connect one board to another board.

@note For detailed instructions, see the appropriate board User's Guide.
@note OTG example can only work with SDK_DEBUGCONSOLE = 1, setting this macro to 0 will lead to build error.
@note Host hid example doesn't support HID report descriptor analysis, this example assume that the device data are sent by specific order. 
      @n For more detail, please refer to the code. For the device list we tested,
      @n please refer to chapter "Peripheral devices tested with the USB Host stack" in "SDK Release Notes xxxx(board name)".

# Run the example
1.  Use the menu to operate the OTG functions, the menu is different for different state, you can input 'p' to get the menu information.
    The menu is as follow:
    - The state is a_idle (A-device is idle):
    @verbatim
    1. bus request;
    2. bus release (set bus request false);
    3. set bus drop false;
    4. set bus drop true.
    @endverbatim

    - The state is a_host (A-device works as host function):
    @verbatim
    2. bus release;
    4. set bus drop true.
    @endverbatim

    - The state is a_peripheral (A-device works as device function):
    @verbatim
    1. bus request;
    4. set bus drop true.
    @endverbatim

    - The state is b_idle (B-device is idle):
    @verbatim
    1. bus request (SRP).
    @endverbatim

    - The state is b_peripheral (B-device works as device function):
    @verbatim
    1. bus request (HNP).
    @endverbatim

    - The state is b_host (B-device works as host function):
    @verbatim
    2. bus release.
    @endverbatim

    - The state is a_vbus_err (A-device works as error state):
    @verbatim
    5. clear error.
    @endverbatim

2.  Connect the two boards UART to the PC and open the COM port in terminal tools.
3.  You can do the following tests.
- Test1: Plug OTG cable to one board, the board works as A-device; plug out the cable, the board works as B-device.
- Test2: Plug one board to the PC. The PC recognizes it as an USB mouse device and the mouse moves around the screen.
- Test3 (bus request test):
    -# Plug OTG calbe to one board (board_1);
    -# plug another board (board_2) to the board_1;
    -# On the com port of the board_1, press "1" key to request bus; Or
        On the com port of the board_2, press "1" key to request bus;
    -# board_1 will work as host, board_2 work as device.
@verbatim
The logs are as follow if press "1" on the board_2.
On the com port of the board_1 displays:
        enter a_host
        host init success
